# Scalable Monolithic Backend Architecture: Build Document/POC

## Project Overview

This document outlines the design, implementation, and reasoning for a scalable monolithic backend architecture using TypeScript and Express. The architecture balances the simplicity of a monolith with the scalability considerations typically associated with microservices, making it suitable for both startups and established projects that value maintainability and development velocity.

## Architecture Vision

We're designing a monolithic Express backend that prioritizes:

1.  **Modularity**: Organized around business domains for clear ownership
2.  **Maintainability**: Following consistent patterns and separation of concerns
3.  **Security**: Implementing robust authentication and protection mechanisms
4.  **Performance**: Utilizing non-blocking I/O and optimization techniques
5.  **Scalability**: Allowing for horizontal scaling despite monolithic design
6.  **Developer Experience**: Providing clear structures and conventions

## Core Architectural Patterns

### 1. Domain-Driven Modular Structure

**What**: We organize the codebase around business domains (users, products, orders) rather than technical concerns (controllers, services, models).

**Why**:

- Creates natural boundaries that reflect the business
- Enables parallel work by different teams with minimal conflicts
- Makes the codebase more navigable ("Where's the user registration logic?" → check the users module)
- Facilitates potential future extraction into microservices if needed
- Reduces cognitive load when working on specific features
- Follows the principle of high cohesion (related things together) and loose coupling (minimal dependencies between modules)

**Structure of a Module**:

```
users/
├── user.routes.ts        # Defines endpoints and connects to controllers
├── user.controller.ts    # Handles HTTP request/response concerns
├── user.service.ts       # Contains business logic
├── user.repository.ts    # Abstracts data access
├── user.model.ts         # Defines data structure
├── user.validation.ts    # Input validation schemas
└── user.test.ts          # Tests for the module

```

### 2. Layered Architecture Within Modules

**What**: Each module follows a consistent layered approach from outside (routes) to inside (repositories/models).

**Why**:

- Creates a clear flow of data and responsibilities
- Prevents business logic from leaking into HTTP-specific code
- Makes testing easier by providing clear boundaries
- Allows specialized optimizations at each layer
- Provides a consistent mental model across the codebase

**Layers**:

1.  **Routes Layer** (user.routes.ts)

    - Defines API endpoints, HTTP methods, and middleware chains
    - Maps routes to controller methods
    - Does not contain business logic

2.  **Controller Layer** (user.controller.ts)

    - Extracts and validates request data
    - Calls appropriate service methods
    - Formats responses
    - Handles HTTP-specific concerns
    - Does not contain business logic or data access

3.  **Service Layer** (user.service.ts)

    - Contains all business logic and rules
    - Orchestrates operations across repositories
    - Independent of HTTP protocol
    - Can be reused by different controllers or background jobs

4.  **Repository Layer** (user.repository.ts)

    - Abstracts database access
    - Provides methods for CRUD operations
    - Handles query construction
    - Independent of business logic

5.  **Model Layer** (user.model.ts)

    - Defines data structure and relationships
    - Includes validations relevant to data integrity
    - Works with ORM to define database schemas

**Flow of a Request**:

```
Request → Routes → Middleware → Controller → Service → Repository → Database
Response ← Controller ← Service ← Repository ← Database

```

### 3. Authentication and Authorization System

**What**: JWT-based authentication with refresh token rotation and role-based access control.

**Why**:

- JWTs allow stateless authentication, reducing database lookups
- Short-lived access tokens reduce the impact of token theft
- Refresh tokens enable longer sessions without compromising security
- RBAC provides granular control over permissions
- Token rotation prevents replay attacks

**Implementation Details**:

1.  **JWT Structure**:

    - Access tokens: Short-lived (15-30 minutes)
    - Refresh tokens: Longer-lived (7-30 days) but revocable
    - Payload includes user ID, roles, and token version

2.  **Token Storage**:

    - Access tokens: Client-side (memory or secure storage)
    - Refresh tokens: HTTP-only cookies + database tracking for revocation

3.  **Authentication Flow**:

    - Login: Verify credentials → Issue both tokens
    - API Access: Verify access token → Process request
    - Token Refresh: Verify refresh token → Issue new access token
    - Logout: Invalidate refresh token

4.  **Security Considerations**:

    - Token versioning for mass invalidation
    - Rate limiting on auth endpoints
    - Token rotation on refresh
    - Secure storage practices

### 4. Error Handling Strategy

**What**: Centralized error handling with custom error classes and environment-specific responses.

**Why**:

- Provides consistent error responses across the API
- Separates operational errors from programming errors
- Prevents sensitive information leakage in production
- Simplifies debugging in development
- Reduces duplicate error handling code

**Implementation Details**:

1.  **Error Types**:

    - AppError: Base class for operational errors (400, 401, 403, 404)
    - Unexpected errors: Programming/unknown errors (500)

2.  **Error Middleware**:

    - Catches all errors thrown in route handlers
    - Formats error responses based on environment
    - Logs errors appropriately

3.  **Development vs Production**:

    - Development: Full error details including stack traces
    - Production: Limited information for operational errors, generic messages for programming errors

4.  **Async Error Handling**:

    - Async wrapper utility to catch promise rejections
    - Consistent promise rejection handling

### 5. Non-Blocking Design

**What**: Asynchronous processing throughout the application using async/await.

**Why**:

- Maximizes throughput by not blocking the event loop
- Allows handling more concurrent requests
- Improves response times by allowing parallel operations
- Simplifies code compared to callback patterns

**Implementation Details**:

1.  **Async Controllers**:

    - All controller methods use async/await
    - Custom asyncHandler utility wraps controllers for error handling

2.  **Database Operations**:

    - All repository methods return promises
    - Connection pooling for efficient resource usage

3.  **External Service Calls**:

    - Promise-based HTTP clients
    - Timeout handling for external dependencies

4.  **Background Processing**:

    - Queue-based architecture for long-running tasks
    - Worker processes for CPU-intensive operations

### 6. Security Implementation

**What**: Multi-layered security approach covering common attack vectors.

**Why**:

- Security requires defense in depth
- Different measures protect against different attack vectors
- Industry best practices reduce vulnerability surface
- Proactive security is cheaper than incident response

**Security Layers**:

1.  **Input Validation**:

    - Schema validation (Joi/Zod) for all inputs
    - Sanitization of user-provided data
    - Strong typing with TypeScript

2.  **Authentication & Authorization**:

    - JWT verification middleware
    - Role-based access control
    - Resource ownership validation

3.  **HTTP Security**:

    - Helmet for secure HTTP headers
    - CORS configuration
    - Content Security Policy
    - HTTPS enforcement

4.  **Rate Limiting & Brute Force Protection**:

    - IP-based rate limiting
    - Account lockout mechanisms
    - API usage quotas

5.  **Data Protection**:

    - Password hashing with bcrypt
    - Sensitive data encryption
    - PII handling procedures

6.  **Injection Prevention**:

    - Parameterized queries via ORM
    - XSS protection
    - NoSQL injection prevention

7.  **Audit & Monitoring**:

    - Security-relevant event logging
    - Failed authentication logging
    - Suspicious activity monitoring

### 7. Database Interaction

**What**: Repository pattern with ORM for data access abstraction.

**Why**:

- Abstracts database specifics from business logic
- Enables easier testing through mocking
- Provides type safety and query building
- Prevents SQL injection through parameterized queries
- Creates a consistent data access pattern

**Implementation Details**:

1.  **ORM Selection**:

    - TypeORM: Mature, feature-rich, supports multiple databases
    - Prisma: Strong type safety, excellent developer experience
    - Mongoose: Best choice if using MongoDB

2.  **Repository Pattern**:

    - Each domain has its own repository
    - Repositories abstract CRUD operations
    - Complex queries encapsulated within repositories
    - Business logic stays in services

3.  **Migration Strategy**:

    - Version-controlled migrations
    - Forward and rollback capability
    - Schema evolution strategy

4.  **Performance Considerations**:

    - Connection pooling
    - Query optimization
    - Strategic indexing
    - Batch operations

### 8. Containerization Strategy

**What**: Docker with multi-stage builds and environment-specific configurations.

**Why**:

- Ensures consistent development and production environments
- Simplifies deployment and scaling
- Isolates application dependencies
- Facilitates CI/CD integration
