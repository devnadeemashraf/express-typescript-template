- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
  - üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance
  - üö± `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
  - üìù `:memo:` when writing docs

### TypeScript Styleguide

- Use ESLint and Prettier with the project's configuration.
- Prefer `const` over `let` when the variable doesn't need to be reassigned.
- Use meaningful variable names.
- Use async/await instead of raw promises when possible.
- Comment your code when the logic is not immediately obvious.
- Organize imports in a consistent manner.

### Documentation Styleguide

- Use [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
- Reference methods and classes in markdown with the custom `{}` notation:
  - Reference classes with `{ClassName}`
  - Reference instance methods with `{ClassName#methodName}`
  - Reference class methods with `{ClassName.methodName}`
